                    Toys, in many ways, are an introduction to the physical world: they’re usually the first objects children touch,  and play with. Wooden toys teach quieter lessons in cause and effect, creativity, and problem-solving than harsh plastic toys. These toys may seem very simple and plain, but they allow children to use their imagination and creativity.  These basic wooden shapes seem like much more to children. They teach children to appreciate the simplicity and beauty around them. 
Wooden toys offer a beautiful, open-ended “blank canvas” for a child to use at their own pace. The extra buttons, sounds, and lights that can make other toys more instantly appealing tend to restrict and direct how children play with them. Wooden toys allow more ideas and fun with their simplicity.
