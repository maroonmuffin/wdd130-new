                <p>Why Wooden Toys?<p>     
                <p class="research" >Research shows that children’s play that features natural elements like wood promotes concentration, focus, and a sense of calm more than other types of spaces. Additionally, touching the wood calms children down, which means it has a neurological impact on a child’s brain. Children naturally form bonds with toys when there are fewer to choose from. The open-ended nature of wooden toys allows children to use their imagination and spend more time with a single toy. These wooden toys are made from a natural material that connects children to nature. Wooden toys create a more nourishing and cozy feeling than plastic toys. Decorated with lead-free paint, and polished with beeswax wood polish, these are as eco-friendly as it gets. 
                    </p>
                  <p>Benefits:</p>
                <p class="toys">The toy market is filled with flashing lights, loud colors, and lots of sounds. Features like these offer pleasure for young children, but they also tend to erase opportunities for problem solving and imagination. Wooden toys tend to be simpler, but they support cognitive milestones in ways that flashy toys can’t. For example, babies start to understand cause and effect: Hitting a toy on the floor makes a noise, and dropping one makes it disappear A wooden toy, like a building block set or a wooden puzzle, shows: “when I do something, it makes something else happen.” Because of the simplicity of wooden toys, parents can expect a tidy house instead of a playroom scattered with legos. They can be used in more ways than plastic toys, and they come with fewer pieces, so there is less mess.
